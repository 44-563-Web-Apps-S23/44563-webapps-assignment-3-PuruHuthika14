            <p>Hockey is my favourite game beacuse,While being difficult, it is also a lot of fun.<b>It is the national sport of India and is played all over the world</b>. Each squad in the game consists of <b>11 players</b>.To score a goal, the team must select a ball using their hockey sticks.</p>
